# Pull request workflow
* create feature branch before start working
* write the code
* commit code with a good commit message
> Commit messages should reflect what was being done.

* push to https://github.com/kwokhuen/client_project
* create a pull request to our organization (DO NOT MERGE TO MASTER)
* tag a tech lead @ksolo for code review and tag a member from the other pair in the group
> Merge conflict: Clear the merge conflict. If you are not sure how to fix it, ask for help.

# Code review workflow
* people who are tagged review pull request and write comment on github
> Comment should reflect what should be changed if there is code problems.

* person who pushes the code will have to back and make the change.
* repeat process until there are no more changes
* if everything looks good, the code reviewer who was tagged can merge to master
